# Advanced-Password-Generator
Advanced Password Generator

- Developed using Python 3.8.5 and tkinter
- auto-py-to-exe is the best actual exe compiler https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/ , use it to compile the current code.


P-GEN generates secure complex passwords composed of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits and punctuations.

Chars length must be a multiple of 4. Example of length inputs: 8 (minimum), 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, ect.

Else, you can generate passwords as much as you need, minimum input is 1.


Coming Improvements: 

- Desgin improvement
- While the software is tested and it's buggless, I am going to implement Exceptions and Errors pop-up messages as on-screen informative explanation.
